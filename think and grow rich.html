        <h2>Think and grow rich - Napoleon Hill</h2>
        <p>"Think And Grow Rich" is an inspirational book serving as a personal development and self-motivation guide to many.
            First published in 1937, this book has made more millionaires than any other such book. <br><br>
            Andrew Carnegie's thought was the inspiration behind the author Napoleon Hill's idea of analyzing the self-made billionaires
            and learning from their experiences. <br><br>
            The thought is a thing. "If I want it, I'll have it" is the magical formula of the self-made billionaires. Learning and 
            pratical implementation of the same will make you stand in the queue of the richest people of this world.
